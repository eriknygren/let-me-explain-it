## Important Notes ##

### 2.0.0 ###

There is a parallel "branch" of the project, released as `2.0.0-alphaX` in NPM. All those releases are based on the master
and will get all the changes of the master. However, `2.0.0` will contain major backwards compatibility breaking changes. Check the
changelog of the branch: https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/blob/milestones/2.0.0/changelog.md

##### 2.0.0 API should be considered unstable

### 1.6.0 ###

- We changed the way timestamps are handled. From v1.6.0 on timestamps are stored and loaded as UTC.
- Support for synchronous migrations has been dropped. `up` and `down` methods in migrations do have a third parameter which is the callback parameter. Pass an error or an error message as first parameter to the callback if something went wrong in the migration.
